# A frontend code challenge

This repository serves as a plain, forkable starting point for your frontend code challenge. This challenge is not a test, in that there are no right or wrong answers. Instead, this is intended to be an open-ended opportunity to show how you write code and solve problems.

We have a simple API that returns a JSON feed of the [most popular New York Times science articles](https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/science.json?api-key=Gwxln5M3geWlhR6UE0TY1FUWKSG3wCil). We would like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, you should add in some type of search, filtering, or sorting capability. Feel free to use any languages, libraries, or frameworks you would like to achieve the task.

You can access the API via the following link:

Start by forking this repo. When you're finished send a link to your public fork.
